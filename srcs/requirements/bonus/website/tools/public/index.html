				<h2>What is Inception About</h2>
				<p>This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.</p>

				<h2>What are we building here ?</h2>
				<p>This build consist in building a full webserver infrastructure containing a webserver (NGINX), a wordpress website and his own php CGI manager and a database used by the wordpress website.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>But what is really a webserver?</h2>
				<p>A webserver is a program running permanently and listening to request on one or several ports. Once the webserver receive a request on the listened port, the webserver decide if the request can be answered by sending an html document stored or if the request needs to be processed by a particular service.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Ok but how the webserver communicate with thoses particulars services?</h2>
				<p>The webserver use whats called a FastCGI (the modern version of a CGI). CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface. When the request has to be send through a pipe or a socket depending on the fact that the service wich will interpret the request is on the same machine as the webserv or on a different one.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>And thats it?</h2>
				<p>Yeah thats it. Once the request has been processed and a response is given, the webserver send back the response to the client that send the request at the beginning (like an user navigator somewhere on the internet).</p>
